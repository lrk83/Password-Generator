# Password Generator

This webpage randomly generates a password to meet user inputed critera. When the user clicks the button to generate a new password they are asked how long they want the password to be. If they enter an integer between 8 and 128, then they are asked if they want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The webpage generates a password of the given length made up of a random set of the selected character types. If the user either enters an invlaid length (less than 8, greater than 128, or not a number) or fails to select at least one type of character, the page alerts them of their mistake, and prompts them to enter a new set of criteria.
